  # EXERCISE 2

import numpy as np
import random

# (a) Create an arbitrary one dimensional array called v1.

v1 = np.random.randint(0,11,10)
print(v1)


# (b) Create a new array (or a view) v2 which consists of items with odd indices of v1.

v2 = v1[v1 % 2 == 1]
print(v2)


# (c) Create a new array (or a view) v3 in backwards ordering from v1.

v3 = v1[::-1]

#EXERCISE 3

#(a) Create a two dimensional array called m1, shape=(4,5).

import numpy as np 

m1 = np.arange(0,20,1).reshape(4,5)
print(m1)

#(b) Create a new array (or a view) m2 from m1, in which the elements of each row are in reverse order.

m2 = m1[:, ::-1]
print(m2)

# (c) Create a new array (or a view) m3 from m1, in which the elements of each column are in reverse order. 

m3 = m1[::-1, :]
print(m3)

#  (d) Remove the first row, the last row, the first column, and the last column of m1, and create a new array (or a view) m4.

m4 = m1[1,1:4]
print(m4)
